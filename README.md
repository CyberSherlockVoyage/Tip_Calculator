 # Key Features:

1. User-Friendly Interface: The program welcomes users with a friendly message and prompts them to input essential details about their restaurant bill.

2. Customizable Tip Percentage: Users can select their preferred tip percentage from three options: 10%, 12%, or 15%.

3. Splitting the Bill: The program allows users to specify the number of people with whom they want to split the bill.

4. Accurate Calculations: It performs accurate calculations for the total bill, tip amount, and the amount each person should contribute.

5. Rounding: The final bill per person is rounded to two decimal places for neatness and precision

# How It Works
## Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:

## User Input: The program starts by displaying a welcome message and prompting the user to enter three pieces of information:

- The total bill amount (a floating-point number).
- The desired tip percentage, which can be 10, 12, or 15 (an integer).
- The number of people sharing the bill (an integer).
- Tip Calculation: Once the user provides these inputs, the program calculates the tip amount by multiplying the total bill amount by the selected tip percentage (converted from an integer to a decimal).

Example: If the total bill is $50, and the user selects a 15% tip, the tip amount is calculated as $50 * 0.15 = $7.50.
Total Bill Calculation: The program then calculates the total bill, including the tip, by adding the tip amount to the original bill amount.

Example: If the total bill is $50, and the tip amount is $7.50, the total bill becomes $50 + $7.50 = $57.50.
Bill Splitting: Finally, the program divides the total bill by the number of people specified by the user to determine how much each person should contribute.

Example: If the total bill is $57.50, and there are 3 people, each person should contribute $57.50 / 3 = $19.17 (rounded to two decimal places for clarity).
Display Output: The program then displays the amount that each person should pay.

# Example
Input example :
```
Total bill: $42.75
Tip percentage: 10%
Number of people: 5
```

Output example :
```
Each person should pay: $8.55
```
These outputs indicate the fair contribution each person should make when splitting the bill, considering the specified tip percentage and the total bill amount. The amounts are rounded to two decimal places for clarity.
